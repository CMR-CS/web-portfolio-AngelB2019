    <h2> The "Halo" seen from space.</h2>
    <p>When reefs are healthy an unusual phenomenon occurs: a perimeter of bare sand forms around the corals. These so-called halos, or bright circles of sand that are devoid of vegetation are visible to satellites miles above Earth. The Halos occuur when the fish and the invertebrate inhabitants eat algae and also sea grass growing near the reef. After some time, all the vegetation in the zone is cleared away; the empty stretch of sand create a footprint around the reef that's visible from space.</p>
    <h2> Hidden Coral Reef</h2>
    <p>For thousands of years — perhaps hundreds of thousands — a sizable coral reef has stretched across the seafloor in the Atlantic Ocean, near the southeastern part of the U.S. And its existence remained a well-hidden secret until a recent deep-sea expedition brought the thriving ecosystem to light. Scientists on board the research vessel Atlantis discovered the reef last week.The site was covered with living corals — "just mountains of it" — growing atop the massive, skeletal remains of dead corals that had likely been inhabiting the area for millennia. </p>
