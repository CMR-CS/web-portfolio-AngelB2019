        <p>A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, whose polyps cluster in groups. The goal of this website is to draw attention of how beautiful Coral Reefs really and how important they are to the wild life around them.</p>
