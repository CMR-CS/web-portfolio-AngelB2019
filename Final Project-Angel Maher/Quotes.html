    <li> "Coral reefs represent some of the worlds most spectacular beauty spots, but they are also the foundation of marine life: without them many of the seas most exquisite species will not survive." ~ Sheherazade Goldsmith</li>
    
      <li>"Ice ages have come and gone. Coral reefs have persisted." ~ Sylvia Earle</li>
      
      <li>"Think about this: If water is the blood of our planet flowing through veinous rivers, streams, and into our oceans, what does that make coral? Our heart. We simply cannot survive without our heart; therefore, it's mandatory we heal and protect our coral reefs now." ~ Ian Somerhalder</li>
    
      <li>"There are ecosystems like coral reefs [at risk] through ocean acidification. Those are valuable things that we should protect." ~ Bill Gates</li>
