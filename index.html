            <p>  In the HTML section we learned about how to format our head, title, body, how to put lists on the web page(the formula for ordered lists as well as unordered lists). We also learned how to create a table and how you get the data to go in a row or be put as a heading for that table, we learned how to link words and pictures to the original text site, and link all of our pages together so that when you have all the links connected to each page you can simply click on the word of the page ypu want and it goes to that page.</p>
