            <p>  In the HTML section we learned about how to format our head, title, body, how to put lists on the web page(the formula for ordered lists as well as unordered lists). We also learned how to create a table and how you get the data to go in a row or be put as a heading for that table, we learned how to link words and pictures to the original text site, and link all of our pages together so that when you have all the links connected to each page you can simply click on the word of the page ypu want and it goes to that page.</p>

        <h2> Web Graphics Unit</h2>
        <img src="images/Web%20GRAPHICS!!.jpg" width=" 600" height="300">
        <p> In the Web Grapics until I learned a lot. I learned how to make pictures in to small files called JPEG, as well as which file types are best for what your working on. The different types of files are JPEG, GIF, PNG, and SVG. One way to tell if the file is the one your looking for is to look at what it has to offer, if it has lossy compression, how many colors you want, if you want animations, etc.

        <h2> JavaScript Unit</h2>
        <img src="images/JS.png" width="300" height="300">
        <p> In the JavaScript unit I learned how to create elements that can change color with a formula when it is clicked on. As well as create pixles to make 8X8 square that requires 40 div class pixels. You have to have all of them correct or else the box will not show up how it is supposed to. for example if you forgot to add the div class rows, the other forumulas will not apply to the page.
